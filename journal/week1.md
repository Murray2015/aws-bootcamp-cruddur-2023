## Made multistage build dockerfile. Struggled slightly with how to deal with installing libs once only. Worked it out (used a venv inside, and copied it across. Much faster build.)

## Added a healthcheck, got confused as curl wasn't installed. Installed Curl. Learned how to check the health check with the inspect command.
